## Homework feedback

### Homework 16

I like how you renamed site.

Lines 78 - 82 you aren't quite where you need to be. I can see your thinking in terms of getting rid of some unnecessary data, but all you really need is a group_by and summarise. The numbers you got are incorrect.

Try this:

```{r}
cover_Q1 <- cover |> filter(Location == "Donnerville 1") |> 
  group_by(cover_type) |> summarise(
    mean_percent = mean(Percent)
  )
```

Lines 88 - 91

Again, you need a group_by and summarise. See the key for solution.

### Homework 18

Interesting question from ds234. Do you mean that you would use the aes() in each geom rather than in the first ggplot() call? I don't think there is a "better" but I'd love to chat about it!

I also appreciate that you asked questions/had commentary outside of your code chunks. Good!
